**Description:**

         We are using the Amazon movie reviews dataset to create a bipartite graph of users and movies. This data is already readily available from the SNAP website. The dataset we have used contains 1540 movies in the training set, with 109694 users and 552980 movie ratings.The test set contains 200 movies, 24722 users (who obviously have all been part of the users in the training set), and 36934 ratings (from the Amazon pull-up). For consistency purposes, and to eliminate outliers, we extracted movie ratings from only those movies on Amazon, which had more than 50 reviewers. We consider metacritic ratings as the absolute rating for evaluation purposes. We scrape their site for ratings of movies weâ€™re interested in evaluating.
